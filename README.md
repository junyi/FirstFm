# FirstFm

Android project to explore the following libraries/architecture:
* [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger) - for dependency injection (DI)
* [Flow](https://github.com/square/flow) - handles UI navigation without Fragment
* [Mortar](https://github.com/square/mortar) - modularisation of views using DI, works well with Flow 
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) & [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) - library to support asynchronous events
* Clean Android Architecture: read about it [here](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture) - a more sustainable and maintainable way to develop Android application
* [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) - a new language which works together with Java while adding more features
